# Image-Segmentation-with-an-Elastic-Shape-Prior
Final project of the Graphical Models class at CentraleSupelec


Everything you need to understand our work and especially the notebook can be find in our paper.


## Introduction

We consider the project as succesful but we were not able to test our implementation on large images. Indeed our code is slow (due to bellman ford algorithm) and should be run in C. We suggest you try the "numby" library designed for this purpose.
